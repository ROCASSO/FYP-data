# project-data

Here is the method of checking the data of the final year project
For the file WMMMSE-ISAC & AWMSE, the meaning of columns are 8 columns in a group, meaning [WMMSE-ISAC S&C sum rate, WMMSE-ISAC Average S&C rate, WMMSE-ISAC SMI rate, WMMSE-ISAC CMI rate, AW-MSE S&C sum rate, AW-MSE Average S&C rate, AW-MSE SMI rate, AW-MSE CMI rate]. 7 groups in total, meaning 56 columns, SNR [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35] dB.
Regarding the MWMMSE-ISAC file, the meaning of coulumns are the same, but 4 columns in a group, meaning [MWMMSE-ISAC S&C sum rate, MWMMSE-ISAC Average S&C rate, MWMMSE-ISAC SMI rate, MWMMSE-ISAC CMI rate].  7 groups in total, meaning 28 columns, SNR [5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35] dB.
For the lines, line 1 to line 101 mean sensing weighting coefficient \omega_{r} from 0.00 to 1.00 with a step of 0.01.
